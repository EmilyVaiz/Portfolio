            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>This project was a part of my composing digital media class final. I decided to create a website that is a space for cultural designs to be displayed in a manner that promotes their growth and awareness. My main focus with this project was that I wanted to open a dialogue about the ethics of high fashion and their usage of traditional patterns and textiles for their own business growth. Often, there is little to no reference to the actual inspiration and credit behind the cultural roots of the design or concept. </p>

            </div>
            <h3>Medium</h3>
            <p>This was one of the first digital projects I worked on, and it was a daunting task to decide how and which platform I was going to implement this idea. I decided to choose Wix and begin the process of templating my content before I went on the site builder. In addition, to build my content I used procreate to draw up the designs and document the artistic process as that would eventually go on the page as well. Editing the photos was minimal but all edits were done on Photoshop to create a similar theme among the timelapses and the outfit photos. </p>

            <h3>Learning Curves</h3>
            <p>The main learning curve with this project was understanding how to use Wix. While I was able to create a working website, there were many functionalities that I felt were not accessible to use as someone who did not have web development knowledge at the time. I wasn't able to have as much creative liberty as I wanted to, so that was something I had to work around. This project made me realize the importance of a solid web design layout and it pushed me to learn more about the programming languages in web development</p>
