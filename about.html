        <h2>A little about me:</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                My name is Emily Florette Vaiz, and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh.</br></br> 

                I was born in New Orleans and I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. I spent some time moving around as a kid and eventually came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for my bachelors.</br></br> 

                Navigating college life during the pandemic was a unique experience that taught me a lot about myself and my future goals. 
                Although I initially pursued a degree in Computational Biology, I realized that my true passions lay elsewhere. 
                The transition from Computational Biology to <strong>Digital Narrative and Interactive Design (DNID)</strong> was daunting, yet it has proven to be a rewarding decision.</br></br> 

                So, what does DNID encompass?</br></br> 
                
                It's a fusion of English narrative and technology. 
                Given the diverse forms narrative and technology can take, this major spans a wide range of fields, allowing me to immerse myself in various technologies.</br></br> 

                <a href="https://www.sci.pitt.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/digital-narrative-and-interactive-design">Here's</a> a link to my universities official webpage on DNID as a major for more information (insert webpage)</br></br> 

                Having switched to DNID in my junior year, I faced the challenge of catching up with current classes and acquainting myself with different practices. 
                Seeking a more technical background, I also opted for a minor in <strong>Computer Science.</strong>
                I wanted to be able to understand the backend portions once the prototype has been made. 
                Specifically, I was interested in the process of gamifying design concepts through narrative design and how that impacts the audience.</br></br>

                I noticed a lack of representation for Women of Color in design and development, especially for those with intersecting identities. 
                This realization drives me to pursue my goals, aiming to break boundaries and contribute to a future where diverse spaces are celebrated.</br></br> 

                My passion lies in inclusive and accessible design, and I am always eager to expand my knowledge in the field and gain new experiences. 
                Coming into college, I took an <strong>American Sign Language</strong> class in hopes to be a part of the certificate program. 
                I fell in love with the language and it became a learning experience in gaining awareness of a diverse culture and community. 
                It also challenged me to consider the different intersectionalities within a community and how design practices can often unintentionally be oppressive to groups of people. 
                What's important is creating a space where change is not overlooked but rather welcomed and consistent will be beneficial for everyone involved.</br></br>

                It has also made me realize the power of multimedia interactive design and the many capabilities it has. 
                Simple concepts can be powerfully portrayed and create a space where the user and the object can exist together in connection with one another. 
                Through a combination of technical expertise and creative pursuits, I aspire to contribute to the creation of a community where design is recognized as the cornerstone of a truly accessible environmentâ€”both in the digital and real world.
                
                This website is a space where I can document my journey as a student, artist, and creator. </br>
